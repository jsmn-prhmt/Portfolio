- I joined Retain as the 4th member of the founding team, a very successful startup with 2 secured funding rounds. A key market player, the founding team (including myself) eventually opted for immigration.
- Learned a lot about the technical aspects of the product as the sole business end of the company, while bootstrapping and sustaining a highly technical startup with clear business goals on a minimum seed fund.
- Responsible for marketing strategy, forecasting, and performance monitoring for anything on Retainâ€™s website and app.
