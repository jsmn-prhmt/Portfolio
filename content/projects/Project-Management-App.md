I’m an aspiring MERN stack developer looking for an entry-level/junior position to grow my passion & gain real-world experience. I’m willing to start with an unpaid position provided there is a quick & clear path to growth and promotion to a paid job.       

I’ve completed a few courses on Udemy for Javascript and React and self-taught myself some other full-stack technologies, eventually exclusively settling on the MERN stack. 
I’ve done multiple small projects to put my skills to the test, and show my level in relevant areas to my future employer.
